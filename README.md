# Online Calculator built with React and Redux

Tested with Jest

Calculating long sums often requires entering several calculations in one long string. This online calculator is intended to perform similarly to any modern calculator, where sums can be combined together to make one longer sum.

Every time a sum is evaluated, the current total will be stored in the total screen. Any further numbers or calculations enetered after an initial sum is evaluated will then be applied to this initial total.

The calculator can be reset by pressing the ```AC``` button.
